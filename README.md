# Code-off 2025 üíª

This repository contains several small projects I created for the Codeoff challenge.  
Click the links below to view each project and its details:

## Projects

1. [Don't Click The Button](./Week1-TrickyButton/README.md)  
   A infuriating and futile button chase that changes from cute to angry. It dodges the cursor, creates copies of itself, explodes, and eventually ‚Äúdies‚Äù.

2. [Snake](./ArcadeGame/README.md)
   The clasic arcade game snake we all know and love with a twist.
   Now you can teleport between portals.

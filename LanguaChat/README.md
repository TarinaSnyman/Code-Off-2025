# LanguaChat

**SHHHHHHH… 🤫**

Don’t tell anyone, but this isn’t just your everyday language learning app.  

LanguaChat is actually a **simulation of a spy communication app**, cleverly disguised as a casual language chat platform. Agents (well… users) can send messages that **look like innocent language practice**, but hide secret information in plain sight.

## Features

- 🌍 Fun, colourful interface with a white and light orange theme  
- 💬 Simulated chat with pre-set decoy messages in different languages  
- 🔒 Messages can be **encrypted** and **decrypted** on click or double-click  
- ⏱ Messages automatically switch back to decoys after a few seconds  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Only pre-configured “agents” (users) can chat  
- 📝 Easy to extend: add new chat partners and decoy messages via JSON

## How it Works

1. **Login as a pre-configured agent** (no public registration – spies only!)  
2. **Open a chat** with your partner. Each chat has its own language theme.  
3. **Send a message**: your typed message will appear as a decoy in the partner’s language.  
4. **Click to translate** the decoy into a readable message in English.  
5. **Ctrl + click** to see the encrypted message.  
6. **Ctrl + double-click** to see the real secret message.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – fully frontend-based for easy setup  
- **JSON files** for chat configuration and decoy messages

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open `home.html` in a browser (or use Live Server extension in VS Code)  
3. Pick a chat partner and start “language practice”…

**Remember:**  
This is a fun simulation unfortunately you are not actually communicating with spies.

# ðŸš« Don't Click The Button

Welcome to the **ultimate annoying/rage-inducing button experience**.  
This project exists to test your patience, destroy your mouseâ€™s dignity, and make you question why you ever tried to click a button in the first place.

## âš¡ Features That Will Make You Lose It
- **Moving Button**: Every time you try to hover or click, the button **dodges** and spawns **fake copies**.  
- **Fake Buttons Everywhere**: The button tries to distract you by spawning fake copies. (The buttons copying power is not great as the copies are a bit smaller)
- **Impossible UI**: Buttons randomly jump all over the screen, forcing you into a futile chase.  
- **Rage Quit Ending**: If you manage to survive long enough, the button diesâ€¦ and the screen **turns into a fake 404 page**, leaving you questioning reality.  
- **Satisfyingly Evil**: Every aspect of the UI is designed to frustrate the user without actually breaking anything.
